# -Weather-Wizard-Quest-
The learning media "Weather Wizard Adventure" is an interactive simulation application developed to support the teaching of natural sciences, particularly weather and climate topics. This media utilizes web-based technology with engaging visualizations to create an immersive learning experience for students.
Learning Objectives  

Cognitive  
• Students can explain the three factors that form weather (temperature, humidity, wind)  
• Students can predict weather changes based on adjusted parameters  
• Students can differentiate the characteristics of various weather phenomena  

Psychomotor  
• Students are skilled in operating the digital interface  
• Students are able to conduct virtual experiments by changing variables  
• Students are skilled in observing and recording simulation results  

Affective  
• Students demonstrate curiosity through simulation exploration  
• Students collaborate in group discussions about simulation results  
• Students show awareness of the importance of understanding weather  

Development Method  
The media was developed using the ADDIE model (Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, Evaluation) with the following stages:  

1. Analysis: Analysis of elementary science curriculum needs and student characteristics  
2. Design: Storyboarding, interface design, and simulation mechanics planning  
3. Development: Development using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and the p5.js library  
4. Implementation: Limited trial in partner school environments  
5. Evaluation: Evaluation and revision based on feedback from teachers and students  

Media Description  
Key Features:  
• Real-time simulation of weather changes based on parameters  
• 3 interactive controls (temperature, humidity, wind)  
• Visualization of weather phenomena (rain, snow, thunderstorms, hurricanes)  
• Time acceleration mode for observing weather patterns  
• "Sun Assistant" guide character with educational tips
