# Weather Wizard Quest
The learning media "Weather Wizard Adventure" is an interactive simulation application developed to support the teaching of natural sciences, particularly weather and climate topics. This media utilizes web-based technology with engaging visualizations to create an immersive learning experience for students.
Learning Objectives  

Cognitive  
• Students can explain the three factors that form weather (temperature, humidity, wind)  
• Students can predict weather changes based on adjusted parameters  
• Students can differentiate the characteristics of various weather phenomena  

Psychomotor  
• Students are skilled in operating the digital interface  
• Students are able to conduct virtual experiments by changing variables  
• Students are skilled in observing and recording simulation results  

Affective  
• Students demonstrate curiosity through simulation exploration  
• Students collaborate in group discussions about simulation results  
• Students show awareness of the importance of understanding weather  

Development Method  
The media was developed using the ADDIE model (Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, Evaluation) with the following stages:  
• Analysis: Analysis of elementary science curriculum needs and student characteristics  
• Design: Storyboarding, interface design, and simulation mechanics planning  
• Implementation: Limited trial in partner school environments  
• Evaluation: Evaluation and revision based on feedback from teachers and students  

Media Description  
Key Features:  
• Real-time simulation of weather changes based on parameters  
• 3 interactive controls (temperature, humidity, wind)  
• Visualization of weather phenomena (rain, snow, thunderstorms, hurricanes)
